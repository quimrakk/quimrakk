- 👋 Hi, I’m @quimrakk
- 👀 I’m interested in programming as a whole, but I'm primarily focusing on Python developement. I"m planning to become a software engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python3 and Github/Git
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... honestly collaboration isn't really on top of my to-do list right now, 
  because I'm still learning, but hit me up if you're interested anyway, I'm not going to pass up an opportunity to get experience.
- 📫 How to reach me: either hit me up on Github or shoot me an e-mail at pascalemanuel@tutanota.com
